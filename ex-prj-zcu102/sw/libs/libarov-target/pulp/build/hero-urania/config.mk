# all flags and rules needed for compiling for this configuration.
# In case the rules are not suitable but flags are still needed, INCLUDE_NO_RULES
# can be defined in the application makefile.
# The 2 included makefiles can also be copied to application, customized and 
# included instead of the one from the SDK.
